## File Descriptions

### `eicar.com`
- A small, benign file commonly used to test antivirus software.
- Used for testing the detection capabilities of the malware detection tool.

### `feature_importance.png`
- A visual representation of the importance of various features used in the machine learning model.

### `feature_info.pkl`
- A serialized Python object containing information about the features extracted from the dataset.

### `feature_scaler.pkl`
- A pre-trained scaler used to normalize features before feeding them into the machine learning model.

### `malware_detection_script.spec`
- A specification file generated by PyInstaller for creating an executable of the malware detection tool.

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above.
- Ensure `pip` is installed.

### Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Malware Detection Tool
1. Execute the `malware_detection_tool.py` script to run the tool.
   ```bash
   python malware_detection_tool.py
   ```
2. Select a file or directory to scan. The tool will analyze the files and provide malware detection results.

### Training the Model
If you wish to retrain the model:
1. Ensure the `MalwareData.csv` file is in the root directory.
2. Run the `train_model.py` script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. The updated model will be saved as `malware_model.pkl`.
